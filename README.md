# Employee Management System

## Project Description
The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage the employee lifecycle within an organization. It serves as a centralized platform for HR and management to handle employee information, track performance, manage payroll, and oversee employee development efficiently and transparently.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure login for different user roles (admin, manager, employee).
- **Employee Profile Management**: Admins can create and manage detailed employee profiles.
- **Performance Tracking**: Managers can set goals, provide feedback, and evaluate employee performance based on predefined criteria.
- **Payroll Management**: Automates payroll processing, ensuring accurate and timely payments.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports on employee activities, performance evaluations, and payroll summaries.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Java Server Faces (JSF)**: Provides a component-based framework for building user interfaces. Utilizes Facelets for templating and creating reusable UI components.

### Backend
- **Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)**: Manages business logic and transactions. Ensures scalability, security, and reliability of the application.

### Database
- **MySQL & Oracle**: Stores data related to employees, performance metrics, payroll, and evaluations. Ensures data integrity and supports complex queries.

### Additional Technologies
- **Java Servlets & JDBC**: Used for handling requests and managing database connections.
- **Model - Entity - Controller (MEC Architecture)**: Ensures a well-structured codebase by separating the data (Model), business logic (Entity), and user interface (Controller).

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines HR processes, reducing administrative overhead.
- **Transparency**: Ensures a fair and transparent evaluation of employee performance.
- **Security**: Protects sensitive data with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple users and processes, scalable for future growth.
